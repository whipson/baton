- name: maestroInterval
  description: >
    Recurring interval for the pipeline. A positive integer. Default is 1.

    For example, an interval of 1 means pipeline will run once per frequency
    unit; an interval of 3 means pipeline will run once every 3 units of frequency.

    Initial time of the pipeline run. This also defines on what time pipeline will recur.
    Must be in yyyy-MM-dd HH:MM:SS format. Default is 1970-01-01 00:00:00.

    For example, if pipeline has a frequency of 'day' and an interval of 1 and the
